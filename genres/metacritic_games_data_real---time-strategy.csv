Rome: Total War,2004-09-22,T,"Rome: Total War is the next generation in epic strategy gaming from the critically acclaimed and award winning Total War brand. The aim of the game is to conquer, rule and manipulate the Roman Empire with the ultimate goal of being declared as the ""Imperator"" of Rome. Set in a time when the mighty Roman Empire emerged to conquer the known world against powerful enemies; when gladiators fought to a bloody death in the Coliseum; when Spartacus defied the might of the empire; when Hannibal led his invincible army and his war elephants across the Alps to strike fear into the very heart of Rome itself; and when Julius Caesar finally smashed the Barbarian Gauls. This was a time of brutal confrontation between civilisation and barbarism, and of civil war as the ancient world's only superpower turned on itself. A completely new Total War engine uses innovative technology and groundbreaking design to bring the world of ancient Rome to life to deliver the biggest and most cinematic battles ever seen in a videogame.

Stalin vs. Martians,2009-04-29,Rating not found,"Stalin vs. Martians, as the name suggests, is a game both absolutely ridiculous and over-the-top. Fun and accessible, it takes a simple arcade-like approach to the genre of real-time strategy. The player controls the Red Army as it defends Earth from the Martian Invasion of 1942, the highly classified military operation which even today remains a closely guarded state secret. Stalin himself conducts the mission briefings, and later even becomes a playable unit. The bold leader is duly serious even as he faces the most ridiculous threat the world has ever known. The game itself is far from standard RTS fare; this is not a realistic and deeply strategic war simulation, but a straightforward, fun and light-hearted arcade-style game complete with power-ups falling from conquered foes in the form of bright shiny coins.
