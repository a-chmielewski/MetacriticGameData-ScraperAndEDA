While retaining many of the features that have become hallmarks of the Romance series, RTK IX (Romance of the Three Kingdoms IX) is vastly different from previous games in the series. Most notable is that players immediately take the rank of a Ruler. Traditionally reserved as the highest rank in the series, the role of Ruler will test any player?s leadership, management and strategy skills. As a Ruler, one of the keys to maintaining authority is a strong corps of loyal officers, so RTK IX?s Officer Development System has been enhanced with a new point and item system. With the new point system, players earn points to increase officer abilities and skills. With the item system, certain items can further an officer?s development, heighten intelligence or improve his abilities in war. Players can now use save data from Dynasty Warriors 4, Dynasty Warriors 4 Xtreme Legends or Dynasty Tactics 2 to obtain a new officer. [KOEI]",74
