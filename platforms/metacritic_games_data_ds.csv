&bull;Solid game but with some flaws
by manlai - Version 1.1.0 - 2009. 11. 09

The Good: fun, easy to pick up and put down gameplay, and a nice twist on the standard tower defense but giving you weapons to directly attack invaders. The ability to repair and upgrade at the end of each level is also a great feature. Another appealing feature (to me anyway) is that you restart the level when you die instead of ending the game. Your progress is saved at the end of each level so picking up again to place is extremely easy.

&bull;Castle Defense without the mindless swiping
by lvillalt - Version 1.1.0 - 2009. 11. 02

Not that I don&#39;t enjoy a castle defense game, but after awhile it does get a little repetitive to me. This game combines castle defense, with progressive upgrades for both hitpoints and defenses.

The gameplay is surprisingly deep, and you have to be smart about your choices, or you can dig yourself into too deep a hole.

Puchi Puchi Virus,2009-05-20,E,"Puchi Puchi Virus does not resemble the ordinary puzzle game. The usual ""object drop"" style was replaced with a more intuitive system of ""object linkage"". Its simple design and surprisingly in-depth game play can addict even the most demanding puzzle game enthusiasts. The object is to form at least a single triangle formation by linking viruses together and erasing them from the screen. Victory conditions vary from mission to mission, but erasing all of the viruses will be the fundamental rule of this game. Erase all the viruses and you win, but if the screen gets filled with the emerging viruses you lose. Note: there is a twist to this system that gives depth to the game play. Viruses turn to stone if left alone for a while, which cannot be selected to form a triangle. However, these stones can be erased if they are within a triangle that you create. With a little luck and practice players can rake in massive points by letting the viruses turn to stones and erasing them all at once. [NIS America]",73
