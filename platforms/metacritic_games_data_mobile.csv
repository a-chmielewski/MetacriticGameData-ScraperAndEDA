- The New York Times

Chaos Rings is the only title I will be playing for quite some time, outside of my normal review requirements.
- 148Apps

The turn-based fighting is gratifying and never got old, and the story and character development remains immersive even in short play sessions.
- Touch Arcade

The iPhone finally has its own triple-A Square Enix RPG that actually reaches the heights of a Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger.
- Slide to Play

The story, and characters found within Chaos Rings are the most interesting and intriguing I have come across for the iPhone, and perhaps I have to go back to Final Fantasy VII to find it&rsquo;s equal.

And advisors with distinctive personalities help you track your cows.The gorgeous hand-painted artwork won Best Visual Arts at the second annual Independent Games Festival.Early reviews:&bull; It's like they took the best parts of Civilization games and combined them with the best part of Choose Your Own Adventure style game books. [Touch Arcade]Playtesters say:&bull; What an addicting game!&bull; Above all, KoDP on iOS is *fun*. The game is ideally suited to the portable platform&hellip; I can pull it up and play a couple seasons when I'm waiting in line or standing on a train platform.&bull; The game is completely brilliant, by the way &mdash; it fits the iOS superbly&hellip; it's quite a bit deeper (in a good way) then the bulk of the Appstore games out there, while still fitting the 'bite size' play session that you need.&bull; A fantastic game, and so far it feels like it is darn near perfectly designed for the platform. The story and characters are so expertly written that I am actually sad that the content is finite and that at some point, no matter how long I stall, I'll begin retreading ground.&bull; I was absolutely gobsmacked at the level and depth and complexity in the game. I can honestly say I have never seen a game with such attention to detail and background,except for something like World of Warcraft or the like!",90

Galaxy On Fire 2,2010-10-27,Rating not found,"Note: Galaxy on Fire 2&trade; is already optimized for iPhone 4 and is available for $6.99/&euro;5,49/&pound;3.99 only for a short time! The price will be raised to $9.99/&euro;7,99/&pound;5.99 when the free universal iPad update with extra high-res textures and special controls launches in only a few weeks. Additional localizations in French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Russian and Chinese will be added too.

Finally, after more than a year in development, the next installment of the epic space shooter Galaxy on Fire&trade;, described in the gaming press as the &#34;Ambassador of the iPhone&#34; and featured by Apple as one of the best 100 games in 2009, is available for the iPhone. Galaxy on Fire 2&trade; sets new standards and offers unprecedented quality and game depth for the sci-fi genre: discover a galaxy with more than 20 solar systems and 100 different 3D space stations. The epic story featurs full voice acting, dramatically portrays the battle for survival of the Terrans, Midorians, Nivellians and Vossks and provides over 10 hours of exciting space adventure. Together with a countless number of freelance missions, over 30 space ships that can be fully customized and a complex trading simulation, Galaxy on Fire 2&trade; is the ultimate sci-fi benchmark in the App Store.

The mercenary Keith T. Maxwell, the hero of the first part, is catapulted through space and time because of a malfunction in the hyperdrive of his space ship. He wakes up 35 years later and finds himself in a very different galaxy. The fragile peace between the four peoples, which has been maintained for generations by the galaxy&rsquo;s diplomats, is on the line: the Voids, an aggressive alien race, have entered the known universe using wormhole technology. United by a common enemy, the former adversaries now fight side by side for the survival of the galaxy.

Determine the fate of Keith T. Maxwell: follow the main plot, complete various missions as you go, or simply hunt and capture goods from your victims. Sell your loot for maximum profit on one of the many space stations so that you can keep your ship equipped with the best weapons and specialist gear. Land on asteroids and mine for ore which can be used in conjunction with blueprints to manufacture rare equipment or trading goods. Using new special weapons, tactical commands to your wingmen and the option of taking over control of the gun turrets of your ship, you must prove yourself in all kinds of situations, from special secret missions to epic space battles, in order to save the galaxy.

Features:

&bull;          A large galaxy with over 20 solar systems and beautifully rendered planets

Aralon: Sword and Shadow HD,2010-12-16,Rating not found,"**Thank you, everyone who has bought the game and given feedback!**

PLEASE NOTE: This game will NOT support 1st and 2nd generation devices at this time. It supports iPhone 3GS and up!
iPhone 4 Retina Display and iPad resolution fully supported.

What the Reviewers say:

Aralon is quite simply the best RPG on the App store. 
-NodPad

 &#34;Aralon possesses more gameplay than perhaps any other iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad game.&#34;
-PocketGamer

&#34;I used to look at my iOS device as a small window into new worlds and fun experiences, and with Aralon I feel like I actually have a fully realized living and breathing universe sitting snugly in my pocket.... I think every iOS gamer needs to pick up this title just to experience what is possible on this constantly expanding mobile platform.&#34; 
- TouchArcade

&#34;Calling Aralon: Sword and Shadow a big game doesn&rsquo;t quite do it justice. It&rsquo;s big in the sense that you can fit other iPhone RPGs inside it. It&rsquo;s big in the sense that it will absorb your free time the way a major console title can. In other words, your desert island iPhone game has arrived. And in case you were wondering, Aralon is great.&#34;

Overall production values and vicious action put Samurai II on par with console 3D brawlers.

With a new virtual d-pad, dynamic camera, environmental puzzles, traps, and vicious new enemies, Samurai II is brand new experience for hack &lsquo;n&rsquo; slash gamers on the go. 

Samurai II sends Daisuke on a quest for revenge across the war-scorched countryside. From a seafaring village to a flying fortress to the legendary Isle of the Dead, the samurai will stop at nothing to hunt down his arch-enemy Orochi. Will he get his Vengeance?

FEATURES:

? Universal app - supports iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPod Touch 3G, and iPad. The game is optimized to take advantage of each device&#39;s strengths.

ABOUT THE GAME
Space Marshals is a Sci-fi Wild West adventure taking place in outer space! This tactical top-down shooter puts you in the shoes of specialist Burton in his hunt for dangerous fugitives after a disastrous prison break.

TACTICAL COMBAT
Use the environment to your advantage. Avoid attacks by taking cover. Flank enemies for extra efficiency, but avoid getting flanked yourself! Use the tools of the trade to gain an edge - frag grenades, flash bangs, distractions, personal shields, proximity mines and more.

STEALTH
Choose your approach with care. Some say running into the fray guns blazing isnt always the best option. Use distractions to single out opponents. Use disguises and covers to sneak past irrelevant guards. Use silenced weapons to covertly reduce the enemy numbers.

LOAD-OUTS & GEAR
Choosing your load-out is a big part of your tactics. In addition to body armor and grenades you can carry one two-handed and one single-handed weapon in each mission - and theres something for everyone. Shotguns, handguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, crossbows, energy weapons, throwing axes and more.

EPISODE 1: WE NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS
When a hostage crisis erupts in the centre of Clappers Wreake, only one man has the diplomatic finesse to defuse a simmering situation before it boils over into a stew of butchery and bloodshed: Detective Inspector Hector. He&rsquo;s all they&rsquo;ve got. Literally. All the other negotiators are dead. Hector has a choice to make: carry out the terrorist&rsquo;s curiously altruistic demands, or watch as his fellow officers are picked off one by one. Hector&rsquo;s still on the fence.

Stagger a drunken mile through the Crime Capital of Britain in the size 9s of Detective Inspector Hector: part criminalist, part kebab-fiend, all cop.

Do all the things you&rsquo;ve dreamed about: hit a tramp with a crowbar, steal a young man&rsquo;s trousers, kick a heroin addict into a cardboard box, enter a porn shop without embarrassment, carry a designer handbag... all in the name of justice, and all in spectacular ground-breaking 2D.

Did we mention? It&rsquo;s not for kids.

This isn&rsquo;t one of those bog-standard Oh-god-where-am-I-how-did-I-get-here-there&rsquo;s-a-screwdriver-in-a-desk-drawer type escape games that the interweb seems to be infested with nowadays. HECTOR:BADGE OF CARNAGE takes you back to the glory days of the point &#39;n click graphic adventure: nonsensical inventory items, favour-hungry reprobates, and a relentless stream of witty one-liners. 

WHAT YOU GET:
 - 18 sordid, filthy, rundown locations
 - 23 well-developed &amp; witty characters (+ 1 stinking drunk)
 - 40 Inventory items (includes Free Lubricant!) 
 - 397 interactive objects
 - 2421 spoken lines of dialogue

Ziggurat (2012),2012-02-17,Rating not found,"ZiGGURAT is the end of a much longer story -- a story which ends with The Last Human On Earth standing atop a stratosphere-high stone pyramid, wielding a laser rifle against an endless wave of relentless alien freaks.

Where did the alien freaks come from? How did our hero get to the top of this pyramid? We have no time to think about such things: there is only time to shoot.

The situation is hopeless: this is the end. Your only goal is to enjoy taking out as many of those alien freaks as you can.

As the aliens jump up and down in their approach to our hero, their eyeballs grow and shrink. As you hold your finger on the screen to steady your aim, your gun’s blast grows and shrinks. Hit larger enemy eyeballs with larger bullets to initiate larger explosions and chain reactions. Shoot as much as you want -- you’ll probably never get enough, and that’s okay, because the enemies will literally never stop coming.

With controls that bring together the best of modern shooting nuances and classic gaming challenge, Action Button Entertainment's ZiGGURAT is a new kind of addiction for iOS.

FEATURES

&amp;#10004; Innovative “Precision Mode” controls: Precision Mode allows the player to control the game entirely with horizontal sweeps on the bottom edge of the screen, meaning your finger doesn’t ever need to cover the on-screen action.

&amp;#10004; “Slingshot Mode” controls: For players who prefer slinging and flinging.

&amp;#10004; Endless . . . with an ending: Watch the world end in the background as you play (though don’t get too distracted).

&amp;#10004; Authentic retro: With sixteen-bit graphics (parallax scrolling!), eight-bit sounds (chiptunes!), and immortal controls and feel, ZiGGURAT is an homage to the games that got us started wanting to make games.

&amp;#10004; Leaderboards, achievements, Facebook, and Twitter: Everyone in the world or your workplace can and will know how many alien freaks you killed before you died. And don't you want to be at the top of the &quot;Total Shots Fired&quot; worldwide ZiGGURAT leaderboard?

&amp;#10004; Deep stat-tracking: ZiGGURAT keeps track of your performance and presents your cumulative multi-session scores in a clean single-screen format for efficient bragging.

&amp;#10004; Amazing music: If the theme music from ZiGGURAT doesn’t impress you, you are not invited to my birthday party (it will be playing on loop at my birthday party).

WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING:

With a unique gameplay mechanic, a wide variety of levels, and beautiful High Definition graphics, Land-a Panda is one App Store title you won&rsquo;t want to miss!

ACTION PACKED
Land-a Panda combines fast action based gameplay with puzzle mechanics, and a simple and intuitive touch control system. Launching Yang Guang from a cannon is as simple as tapping on it, although as you progress more complex objects are introduced, making your timing and planning ever more crucial.

LOVE IS IN THE AIR
Unfortunately it&rsquo;s not quite as simple as getting Yang Guang to meet with Tian Tian. If you don&rsquo;t collect any of the golden love coins on your way, Tian Tian will not be impressed! To get maximum points (and love!) you must collect all three golden coins in each level, while avoiding a variety of enemies and obstacles along the way.

TIMING IS EVERYTHING!
Reaching Tian Tian will not always be easy, with a multitude of different cannons and obstacles to traverse Yang Guang through in order to reach his soul mate. From moving and rotating cannons, to teleports and spooky ghosts to avoid, you&rsquo;ll need to master a number of skills to impress this fine lady.

STUNNING HD GRAPHICS
Yang Guang will travel through a number of different worlds, each of which is presented in bright and colourful High Definition Retina graphics. Easy to learn but difficult to master, can you collect all the golden coins and win the heart of the gorgeous Tian Tian?

OPENFEINT + GAME CENTER
With a custom OpenFeint and Game Center integration, you&rsquo;ll never have to leave the game to view your achievements and high scores.

*** 4,5 out of Five stars at Qwertyhub.com ***

IMPORTANT! 6th Planet does NOT run on iPhone 1st gen iPhone, iPhone 3G and iPod 2G!
FRENCH, SPANISH AND GERMAN LANGUAGE VERSION COMING SOON!

6th Planet tells the story of a near future, where the planet Saturn suddenly changes into a possible place for humans to live. To find out what is going on, a monkey is sent into space. This is the beginning of a series of events that will determine mankind&rsquo;s future.

The goal of the game is to guide your space pod to the landing site on the other side of the level. With only two buttons to work with, it is a simple concept that&rsquo;s easy to pick up, but hard to master. The Story Mode contains 50 levels, divided across 7 worlds. This stands for at least four hours of gameplay. If you succeed in finishing this mode, you unlock the Master levels, which is a collection of very challenging levels for you to try out. This mode will be updated in the future with more content.

The comic story, in between the levels, consists of a total of 188 screens, which is two comic books worth of images. The story is co-written and drawn by the studio that&rsquo;s responsible for the Oscar nominated animation films The Triplets of Belleville and The Secret of Kells. Screens are colored by Raymund Lee, famous for his work on Marvel&rsquo;s Wolverine series.

Helsing&rsquo;s Fire features a brand-new puzzle mechanic never before seen: use the touch-screen to position Helsing&rsquo;s torch to illuminate different combinations of monsters, then destroy them in the correct order using Raffton&rsquo;s supply of different tonics. The quick, rewarding puzzles make it a perfect game for brief play-sessions, but you&rsquo;ll always want to play &lsquo;just one more level&rsquo;!

A HUGE, DARK UNIVERSE
With puzzles set across three worlds, with 30 different levels in each world, all featuring thirteen different monster types including three bosses, Helsing&rsquo;s Fire provides an incredibly rich, deep, and varied game experience. And because on replays puzzles are re-generated randomly, the game will always be fresh!

COMPELLING SETTING
The Victorian theme, Gothic setting, and engaging characters make Helsing&rsquo;s Fire one of the most appealing story-oriented puzzle games released. Add to that the distinct minimalist style of the character portraits, the incredible dynamic lighting of the shadows cast by your moving torch, and an original soundtrack, and it&rsquo;s clear that Helsing&rsquo;s Fire presents an epic experience. Designed just for the iPhone, this is high-quality mobile gaming at its finest.

MULTIPLE MODES AND ACHIEVEMENTS
As if the 90 distinct levels weren&rsquo;t enough, Helsing&rsquo;s Fire also comes with an additional Survival Mode, for the bravest of the brave! And when you&rsquo;ve stood against the horde as long as you can, you can post your scores on the fully-integrated Crystal leaderboards, earning achievements for your accomplishments and claiming bragging rights from your friends.

Tom Clancy's HAWX,2009-12-09,Rating not found,"Tom Clancy's HAWX (high-altitude warfare) promises to revolutionize the way players think about combat in the sky. The story begins in the year 2012. As the era of the nation-state draws quickly to a close, the rules of warfare evolve even more rapidly. More and more nations become increasingly dependent on private military companies (PMCs), elite mercenaries with a lax view of the law. The Reykjavik Accords further legitimize their existence by authorizing their right to serve in every aspect of military operations. While the benefits of such PMCs are apparent, growing concerns surrounding giving them too much power begin to mount. The Enhanced Reality System is the backbone of the HAWX flight experience: radars and incoming missile detection, anti-crash system, damage control system, tactical map and information relay, and weapons trajectory control. E.R.S. also allows players to issue orders to their squadron, making this system as iconic to HAWX as the Cross-Com system is to Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter. Players can ease into their flight missions and gain a level of comfort with the use of the assistance mode. Once employed, players can take full advantage of their technological support through the E.R.S and gain maximum piloting security. If the situation calls for the player to unleash the full potential of the aircraft, the assistance mode can be switched off and all safety features will be deactivated. For the first time ever in the air-combat genre, players can experience the entire solo campaign in four-player JUMP IN co-op mode. In PVP mode, players can challenge up to 15 friends in intense dogfighting sessions and find out who's the top gun. Winning players are rewarded with experience points and money to unlock more weapons. Players have the opportunity to take the throttle of over 50 of the world's most famous aircrafts, as well as being able to dogfight over realistic modern landscapes that have endured years of post-war trauma.

Russell Stone is a Jewish Rabbi at a poor synagogue in New York City. He is a devout man with a problem. Membership is way down and he lacks the funds to keep his synagogue open. Things are looking very bleak, and he has grown progressively more cynical and bitter with the passage of time.

Just as he is on the verge of packing it all in, he receives some interesting news. A former member of his congregation has died and left the Rabbi a significant amount of money. A blessing? Or the start of something far more sinister? Can Rabbi Stone just accept the money and move on? His conscience says no.

DESCRIPTION
ZombieSmash! is a &ldquo;Survival Comedy&rdquo; game, featuring undead-themed castle defense and entertaining, physics-based gameplay. The game casts players as Joey, a lone survivor pit against a herd of writhing, unrelenting zombies - to defeat the undead masses, players must use their fingers to flick and smash them until they&#39;re un-undead.

&bull;To aid players in their fight, over 20 specials and upgrades allow for creative zombie demolition - including fun implements like asteroids, wrecking balls, liquid nitrogen and a gigantic, rolling boulder &ndash; combine specials (for instance, smash nitrogen-frozen zombies with a boulder!) for added hilarity.

&bull;Sophisticated ragdoll physics produce unique and hysterical zombie deaths, and the proprietary SplatterEngine&trade; renders adorable cartoon blood and gore in a convincing and entertaining fashion.

&bull;Three game modes provide limitless replay value:
oCampaign Mode challenges players to survive for 31 intense days against the mounting zombie threat.
oEndless Siege Mode confronts them with a never-ending zombie assault - hold out as long as possible, racking up an ever-rising body count.
oSandbox Mode gives you all the tools to rain destruction down on those stinking, moaning zombies without any of the peril.

&bull;Social features including Chillingo&rsquo;s Crystal and Playhaven for online and community support, and the ability to share screenshots of your best ZombieSmashing moments!

&bull;Original soundtrack produced by famed game music composer Chris H&uuml;lsbeck, the talented musician behind the scores to classic games like Turrican, Giana Sisters and the Star Wars: Rogue Squadron series.",82

Magnetic Billiards: Blueprint,2011-07-16,Rating not found,"When veteran video game designers John and Ste Pickford discovered a mysterious bundle of papers hidden in the family attic, who could have guessed it would lead to one of the best new modern puzzle games in years?To John and Ste's delight their work revealed an addictive, compelling, and completely original strategic puzzle game, which they named 'Magnetic Billiards: Blueprint'.  The game plays very much like pool, using intuitive touch controls.  The twist is that balls of the same colour stick together magnetically when they touch.Magnetic Billiards tables have no pockets, instead balls are removed by building clusters of connected balls, with extra rewards for creating recognised cluster shapes. Points are scored based on the skill displayed and risks taken each shot, and grades are awarded for the total score earned when a table is cleared.Clearing a table is the easy part.  Trying to earn high scores and achieve high grades is where the surprising genius of the game becomes apparent.Sure, anyone can beat an F grade, but will you ever get an A grade?  Is there a higher grade than A?  Can you unlock all the tables?Although easy to play the game is fiendishly addictive, as the simple game mechanic is deceptively subtle and deep.  Even after months of play you'll still be figuring out new ways to beat your previous best scores and grades.As you aim for higher and higher you'll realise that no two games of Magnetic Billiards: Blueprint are ever alike.  Re-playing each table presents you with an endlessly fascinating challenge, as new strategic decisions need to be made with every shot to maximise the points earned.Magnetic Billiards: Blueprint is completely FREE to play, and packed with great features:&bull; 20 graded 'Casual' tables to unlock, requiring skill and careful play to earn the highest grades.&bull; A 'Grand Score' which keeps track of the sum of your best ever scores on each table.&bull; A 'Grand Tally' which keeps track of the sum of all the points you've ever earned across every game played.&bull; Full Game Center support, including separate Leaderboards for both the iPhone / iPod touch and iPad versions.&bull; Dozens of Achievements to discover.&bull; Completely 'universal' app, with fast and responsive gameplay on both the iPhone / iPod touch and the iPad.&bull; Full HD graphics on iPad and Retina displays.Addition optional expansions can be purchased in-game, including new content and new game modes:&bull; Three Arcade Games - Relentless, Sardines and Countdown - ranging from stress-free relaxing gaming, to manic, fast-paced challenges.&bull; 20 graded 'Serious' tables, offering a deeper challenge for more advanced players.&bull; A one time only purchase of a 'Skeleton Key', unlocking all existing content and any future content, as well as allowing a short-cut to instantly unlock any table.",81
Solomon's Boneyard,2010-09-08,Rating not found,"Twenty-Three years before the horrifying events chronicled in &#34;Solomon&#39;s Keep,&#34; the Wizard&#39;s college first suspected they might have a problem with one of their new graduates.  A battle mage was dispatched to put an end to this young &#34;Solomon Dark&#34; before he could grow in power...

* * *

In Solomon&#39;s Boneyard, you can play as one of seven young wizards, with over thirty skills to master.  The game is a survival two-thumb shooter, where you will face wave after wave of undead hordes, while gaining levels and choosing new skills to fight with.

The game comes complete with a high score list, and an innovative perks system that will allow you to grow in power the more you play.

* * *

For veterans of Solomon&#39;s Keep, the game can be described as &#34;endless survival-horror Solomon&#39;s Keep.&#34;  While you will not progress through a dungeon, you will level up, and gain new and more powerful skills and items while you fight hordes of undead in the boneyard.

Solomon&#39;s Boneyard differs from Solomon&#39;s Keep in these ways:

1. Your mana recovers faster.  You start out as a member of the college&#39;s junior faculty, boasting more skills than the new graduage in Solomon&#39;s Keep.

2. A new primary and secondary skill set is available, utilizing cold magic.  

3. All the skill welding is available, but you&#39;ll need to unlock the bonus characters to get to them.  Characters in Solomon&#39;s Boneyard cannot get new primary skills, and are stuck with the ones they start with.

4. Gold is persistent.  Any gold you win in a game sticks around forever, for you to buy perks.

5. The perks system allows you to start your game with your favorite skills, or other bonuses.

6. You can find powerup bonuses to increase your damage or level up a skill.

7. Wizards with more than one primary skill can weld skills starting at level 5 instead of level 10.",81

100 Rogues,2010-05-04,Rating not found,"Published by Fusion Reactions
Developed by Dinofarm Games

100 Rogues is an arcade-style dungeon crawling adventure for iPhone, iPod Touch and the iPad. Maps, monsters and loot all generate randomly, making each playthrough a new experience. You won&rsquo;t find another game that looks, plays, or sounds like 100 Rogues, as it&#39;s got fully animated 2D pixel art, and classic videogame-style music.

100 Rogues is about player improvement more than character improvement, as your unfortunate Rogue&rsquo;s death is almost guaranteed for most players. Like a game of Tetris or Galaga, 100 Rogues isn&rsquo;t about completion; it&rsquo;s about seeing how you can do in one play session.

Explore randomly-generated dungeons; find rare magical weapons, armor and other artifacts; meet strange, interesting monsters and do battle in a thought-provoking, turn-based-strategy combat system.  Our characters have their own unique skill trees, and as you gain experience you can unlock new skills to survive against tougher opponents.

&#34;Overall Carnivores is unbelievably deep and features unlimited replay value. Every hunt is different, there&rsquo;s tons of strategy involved and it&rsquo;s really an iDevice enthusiast&rsquo;s dream.&#34;  &ndash; AppVersity Review

************************************************************
Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter is a console-quality hunting game which lets players explore huge non-linear locations as they attempt to track down a variety of dinosaurs that are armed with some of the most advanced AI on the platform.  As a result, these are no &ldquo;pea-brained&rdquo; dinosaurs &ndash; these are dangerous creatures that are able to see, hear and sense the hunter.  If you&rsquo;re not careful, it&rsquo;s very easy for the hunter to become the hunted.

With 15 different dinosaurs across 5 distinct environments including pine forests, muddy marshes and rolling hills, how you approach your target is important.  Wind direction, scent and the use of a special dinosaur call are all key elements in tracking your prey. 

Game Features:
&bull; 3D dinosaurs, from the Herbivorous (plant eating) for novice hunters to the Carnivorous (meat-eating) for experts;
&bull; Choose from among six different weapon types &ndash; from a sniper rifle to an X-bow;
&bull; Utilize the map and radar feature to locate and track dinosaurs;

X2 Snowboarding is a fast-paced extreme sports simulation, combining console quality graphics &amp; physics with arcade style game play. Players compete in a series of freestyle, race &amp; trick-race events across an international stage.

&bull;Fluid motion and touch controls 
&bull;Optimal graphics &amp; unique visual style 
&bull;Bluetooth &amp; local WiFi multiplayer 
&bull;Full motion-captured player animations
&bull;In-game rewind: re-wind and re-play during your run to retry missed opportunities
&bull;Adrenaline: slow down time and enhance your handling and trick performance capabilities
&bull;Replay save system
&bull;Tru Thoughts Recordings licensed soundtrack: featuring Quantic, Bonobo &amp; Mr Scruff
&bull;Official Salomon in-game boards unlocked as you progress

*****************************************

After learning the basics and earning your boarding pass from the Boarding School, take the character of your choice to the varied international slopes. Choose from 6 colourful boarders; Adler (Germany), Yukiko (Japan), Edward (UK), Katie (Canada), Aaron (America) &amp; Terhi (Finland), each with individual strengths and weaknesses suiting  particular playing styles and event types.  Your boarder will be taken from the commercial slopes of USA, to going off the beaten track under the setting sun of Japan, to taking illicit advantage of the ski-only slopes in Switzerland, the perilous back country traverse of Chile, the night-life of a snow-village resort in Canada and the final treacherous cliff edge teeter in New Zealand.

The boarding is performed with an intuitive combination of iPhone accelerometer tilt &amp; on-screen touch/gesture control- with 2 varying tweaked control mechanisms to choose from.
Once you&rsquo;ve got the hang of the controls, you&rsquo;ll soon realise that X2 Snowboarding is no ordinary snowboarding game! Successfully performing and chaining spins, flips, grabs, grind manoeuvres &amp; buttering bestows your boarder with time-warping abilities to rewind &amp; replay sections of the course in real-time, release adrenaline to slow down time to perfect tricky manoeuvres or &lsquo;boost&rsquo; to leave your opponents standing. Using these special abilities wisely will give your boarder the edge in competition.

For a different challenge, take on your friends in multiplayer events over a Bluetooth or Wi-fi connection. In our first update (coming soon), online multiplayer will become available allowing for infinite competition once you&rsquo;ve excelled your friends and our AI.

Burn the Rope,2010-12-20,Rating not found,"66% off for first 72 hours !! Get it now. 

From the team that brought you Thumpies &ndash;&lsquo;game that reinvented the rhythm genre&rsquo;; here comes one of the most original games this year. Burn the Rope is a unique game for the pyro in all of us. All you have to do is feed the fire! 
 
Burn the Rope is a challenging game where you try to burn as much rope as you can in each level. There&rsquo;s a catch! The fire only burns upwards, leaving you to tilt and turn your phone to keep your flame alive!
 
As you progress through the levels, you&rsquo;ll encounter bugs crawling along the rope. Different bugs have different reactions to the flame. For example, the ant changes the color of the flame so you can burn different colored ropes, and the spider shoots out a web bridge so you can access parts of the level that you could not before.
 
Burn the Rope is incredibly fun and addictive. You will actually feel like you&rsquo;re burning a rope, yet there&rsquo;s no need for a fire extinguisher! 
Features:
&bull;                      80 exciting levels with more coming soon!

You select one of six magical elements and together with your adjacent allies, you expand, stack and attack your way to victory.

??????????????????

Imagine a dark tower &ndash; where the forces of the world are harnessed by those brave enough and smart enough to control them. A wizard&rsquo;s power brings these elements together: the wicked wind, rolling water, contracting ice, tumbling earth, lapping fire and sudden lightning. They will compete to establish control for once and for all.

Wizard Hex &ndash; a seemingly simple game. Played on a elegantly designed hexagonal board, you choose your element and then challenge yourself against as many as five other players or as few as one smart computer to attempt to be the strongest and to take forever control.

You begin as an Apprentice, learn to be a Journeyman and eventually challenge yourself and others at the Wizard Level. You play not only your own element but the friendly elements found on either side. Together you struggle to Expand to new regions, Transmute from Bronze to Silver to indestructible Gold, and Attack when the opportunity arises. All the time defending and consolidating a winning position. A new strategy game of resource management and area control &ndash; Chess or Go for the modern age.

Wizard Hex is such a great strategy game that we are releasing it first as a traditional abstract piece moving game. Throughout the course of 2011 we will be populating the game with unique Spells that will allow for a more modern fantasy experience.

Highborn,2010-06-02,Rating not found,"Check out the Highborn gameplay trailer at http://www.youtube.com/JetSetGames

********************
&ldquo;Highborn comfortably sits as one of the best turn-based strategy games we have played on the iPhone.&rdquo; &ndash; TouchArcade.com

&ldquo;Combines some of the best aspects of the genre&#39;s top alumni with a healthy dose of tongue-in-cheek comedy. 5 out of 5!&rdquo; &ndash; AppSpy.com

&ldquo;The iPhone hosts plenty of turn-based strategy games, but few with the humor and pop of Highborn.&rdquo; &ndash; IGN.com

&ldquo;I would recommend Highborn to strategy game experts and those looking to try one out for the first time too.&rdquo; &ndash; TouchReviews.net

********************

Highborn is a casual, turn-based strategy game, perfect for gaming on the go, or for anyone looking for an intelligent, tactical experience without the frenetic play of a traditional real-time strategy game.

Highborn features two types of strategy games in one. Move your army around an overhead map to capture points of interest and receive spells and combat support; then dive into 3D combat to deploy those advantages against an unsuspecting enemy!

All the fun and fighting is set against an irreverent take on the classic good-versus-evil tale. Eight wacky heroes banter about, trading dialogue full of miscommunications and outrageous assumptions.

A LIGHT TOUCH &ndash; Enjoy a satisfying strategy experience, no matter if you spend minutes or hours with the game. 

TIME FOR A NEW STRATEGY &ndash; A unique blend of strategic movement and 3D combat that caters to a variety of gameplay styles and offers immense replayability.

MULTIPLAY AT YOUR PACE &ndash; Think, then act in round-based play against your Facebook friends, and have multiple games going at once. 

MANY STYLES OF PLAY &ndash; Unlock hero characters for access to different abilities and play styles, along with different strategies to use against your opponents.  

Highborn is developed by a team of industry veterans, many of who created the original Command &amp; Conquer products, including Rade Stojsavljevic, Adam Isgreen, Joseph B. Hewitt, IV, and Westwood Studios Co-Founder, Brett W. Sperry.

COMING SOON:

Undo button, multiplayer that does not require Facebook, and more!

The player, as the hero, becomes involved when sent a Devil Summoning Program via email which allows him to converse with and recruit demons to fight for him, storing them as digital data on his computer.In the aftermath of the ensuing destruction, the hero must decide what kind of world should be created on its ruins. Will he side with the angels and create a kingdom of absolute order that would last for a thousand years, or will he side with the demons and bring about an eternal anarchy, or will he choose neither, and destroy everyone who opposes him?GAMEPLAYThe game features two types of characters: Humans and Demons. A key facet of game play involves collecting demons. The human Hero acquires these demons via negotiation, bribing and coercion during battle. Once acquired, they can be stored in the party's portable computer and summoned for a small amount of money to be used in battle, and a constant feed of Magnetite (a secondary currency in the game) to be maintained outside of combat. If a demon is defeated during a battle, they must be revived before they can be used again.A notable aspect of the game is that the player can combine two or three demons and create a more powerful demon.HUMANS:Human characters can equip firearms with special ammo, melee weapons, and multiple pieces of armor from helmet to boots, although certain weapons can only be wielded by a character of a specific alignment. Humans are also the only ones capable of leveling up and having their Stats upgraded at the discretion of the player.DEMONS:There are a wide variety of demons from various mythologies in Shin Megami Tensei; each has its own unique statistics, and a skillset of up to three abilities or spells.!NOTEThis game is not translated and displays Japanese text only.",72

Many famous Trainers from every region featured so far in the Pokémon video games have gathered on Pasio along with their partner Pokémon and formed their own sync pairs. You are the main character in Pokémon Masters, and you'll embark on an exciting adventure with a Pokémon partner of your own. Along the way, you'll meet various Trainers, make new friends, and work together with them as you advance through the story. Once you've made friends with other sync pairs, you can form a team that's all your own and aim to become the champion of the Pokémon Masters League tournament being held on Pasio.

Team Up with Famous Trainers

Meeting and working together with formidable Trainers from other regions is a core aspect of Pokémon Masters, and it brings an interesting twist to the game's story. Some of the sync pairs you'll encounter on Pasio include the legendary Pokémon Trainer Red and his Charizard, the powerhouse Trainer (and grandson of the famous Professor Oak) Blue and his Pidgeot, and Cynthia, the Champion of Sinnoh, along with her Garchomp.

Zombie Crisis 3D,2010-11-04,Rating not found,"on sale now!
if you think it&#39;s easy, try difficuty-nightmare.
Until SEGA gets the lead out and brings House of the Dead over to the iPhone, you can indulge your zombie-killing tendencies with Zombie Crisis 3D. It plays out like an arcade light gun game; you have zero control over the movement of your hero. All you do is point and shoot. This lack of &#34;control&#34; doesn&#39;t upset me too much, as I have a real fondness for light gun games and Zombie Crisis 3D does a good job replicating that arcade experience. ---IGN

Zombie Crisis is an intense, finger-friendly 3D rail shooting game for the iPhone/iPod Touch.

Abandoning the &#39;traditional&#39; joystick-based FPS, Zombie Crisis releases your fingers from the difficult movement &amp; weapon control and delivers a new, innovative style that lets you focus on the action.

In Zombie Crisis, a bio-accident has taken place at the Argo Company, turning its infected staff into bloodthirsty zombies. When the disaster is about to sweep through the States, a female mercenary soldier, Dana, receives an order to investigate the situation at Argo&#39;s lab. Will her investigation lead to a one-way street into those dangerous zombies? Or will she find something even more dangerous than the Zombie Virus?

Features:

21 maps, hundreds of zombies and 4 big bosses.
3 weapons including pistol, shotgun, and machine gun.
Beautiful 3D graphics, professional sound production, and a gripping storyline. 

what&#39;s next

1. Added a new melee weapon &ndash; Fighting Dagger. Drag your finger across the screen to wield the dagger. Cut up nearby zombies when you are out of bullets.

Blood Bowl,2014-07-30,Rating not found,"A brutal team sport unfolding in a parallel fantasy world based on Warhammer and American football, Blood Bowl invites gamers to form a team of players from races including: Orcs, Elves, Humans, Dwarfs and many other fantasy creatures, and launch themselves into battle in the bloodiest of arenas. This strategy sports game combines a fine balance of tactics and bone crunching action! The game offers two game modes. The first, which is fully real time, offers spectacular gameplay with intense battles between blocking linemen and daring displays of agility of players leaping and dodging through opponents tackle zones, while powerful spells and dirty trick special plays are unleashed across the field. All this creates a highly charged atmosphere. Of course, since it is sometimes difficult to keep an eye on the entire field at once, the game's interface offers different tactical and strategic setups, while the AI is responsible for managing the players on the field. The second game mode, an actual turn-based game, is a treat for players of the original board game because it is an exact replica of Games Workshop's tabletop masterpiece. The original rules have been faithfully reproduced, and it contains all of the devices, strategies, play and rhythm of the original game. [Focus Home Interactive]",62

Cao Cao&rsquo;s subordinates felt that Guan Yu behaved far too rudely and arrogantly by leaving without bidding farewell and wanted to pursue and bring him back. However, Cao Cao gives Guan Yu a clear passage to travel as he is well aware that none of his generals can defeat him.

Guan Yu begins his journey to reunite with his sworn brother, Liu Bei. Along the 5 passes, he encounters 6 generals. The generals of Cao Cao refuse to clear the way for Guan Yu. Infuriated, Guan Yu kills all of them. However, he soon realizes that Liu Bei was no longer in Yuan&rsquo;s territory and had left for Runan. Guan Yu and his party then make their long journey back and finally reunite with Liu Bei and Zhang Fei.

Final Fantasy: All The Bravest,2013-01-17,Rating not found,"FINAL FANTASY ALL THE BRAVEST is a touch-action RPG in which you continuously battle enemies to advance through the game’s many stages. Defeating foes earns you the experience points you need to level up, which in turns grants you character slots to add more and more members to your party.
Combat is based on the classic Active Time Battle (ATB) system of the FINAL FANTASY series. Every character possesses an ATB gauge that displays the time remaining until that character can execute an action. When the gauge is full, simply tap or drag your finger over the character to attack. Touch multiple characters in quick succession to experience exhilarating and fast-paced battle unlike anything you’ve ever played before!
Once every three hours, the Fever option will appear. Once activated, you will be able to attack without waiting for ATB gauges to refill as long as the chocobo-themed music is playing. Deal as much damage as you can before the battle fever ends!",25
