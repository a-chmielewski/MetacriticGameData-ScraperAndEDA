The game features two play modes:

* Platforming - the player maneuvers the car from roadway to roadway, performing connecting stunts to reach the finish line.
* Time Trails - the player races around stunt-filled circuits to beat the lap records.

Each mode of play is packed full of level content, increasing in difficulty, through 25 Platforming levels and 11 Time Trail levels. There is enough content for long, lasting game play.

**** CONTROLLABILITY ****

The car handling has been designed from the ground up for the accelerometer. The controls are easy, precise and fun. So much so that the player can hug the edge of a corner, using a jet assisted power-slide, and still feel perfectly in control. The car also features mid-air flight controls, allowing the player to nudge the angle of flight and adjust speed with air-braking. It feels very natural to play and we believe it to be the best driving experience on the iPhone to date.
