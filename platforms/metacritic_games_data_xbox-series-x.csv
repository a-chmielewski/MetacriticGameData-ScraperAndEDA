Reimagined gameplay creates fundamental advances that you’ll feel across every mode in FIFA 22. A goalkeeper rewrite brings more composure and consistency to the most important position on the pitch, new ball physics reimagine every pass, shot, and goal, and explosive sprint lets you feel the acceleration of the game’s quickest players.
•	Goalkeeper Rewrite - A brand new goalkeeper system brings a new level of intelligence to the last line of defence, unlocking more reliable shot-stopping and smarter decision-making between the posts. In FIFA 22, goalkeeper positioning personality replicates the different styles of keepers throughout the game - from the lightning-fast reflexes of world-class shot stoppers like Jan Oblak to the aggression of sweeper keepers such as Ederson.
•	True Ball Physics - Real-world data imported into FIFA 22 takes the game’s ball physics to a new level of realism. Tuned parameters including speed, swerve, air drag, air resistance, ground friction, and rolling friction mean every touch, trap, shot, volley, pass, and dribble will look, move, and fly like the real thing.
•	Explosive Sprint - A new gameplay mechanic that changes the dynamic of one-on-one situations, Explosive Sprint gives you more control over acceleration when dribbling or defending. Lure opponents in and choose when to unleash your full speed to get away from the defender as you drive your team forward in attack.",78
