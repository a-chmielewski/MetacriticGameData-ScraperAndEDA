# Metacritic Game Data Scraping and Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to scrape, analyze, and visualize video game data from Metacritic, focusing on uncovering trends, correlations, and insights within the gaming industry. The project is divided into several parts, starting with data collection via web scraping, followed by data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of findings.

## Contents
- `Metacritic-games-scraper.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for scraping game data from Metacritic.
- `Metacritic-games-EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis and visualization of the scraped data.
- `Metacritic-games-scraper.py`: Scraper in form of python script.
- `Metacritic games data report.pdf`: EDA exported to the PDF file.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and guide on how to use the project.

## Objectives
- To collect comprehensive game data across various platforms from Metacritic.
- To analyze trends in game ratings, genre popularity, and the impact of release timing on game reception.
- To compare critic scores with user scores and identify factors influencing game success.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Custom web scraping scripts are used to gather game information from Metacritic, adhering to ethical web scraping guidelines.
2. **Data Cleaning**: The raw data is cleaned and preprocessed to facilitate analysis, including handling missing values and normalizing data formats.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis and visualization techniques are employed to explore the data and uncover patterns.
4. **Visualization**: Key findings and insights are presented through informative visualizations.

## Usage
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8.10
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, BeautifulSoup, requests

### Running the Notebooks
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
3. Open `Metacritic-games-scraper.ipynb` to run the scraping scripts.
4. Run `Metacritic-games-EDA.ipynb` for data analysis and visualization.

## Findings
Findings are available in the report or EDA notebook.

## Future Work
- Extend the data collection to include genres and additional details such as developers and publishers etc.
- Perform sentiment analysis on user reviews to gauge public perception of games.
- Explore machine learning models to predict game success based on available data.
